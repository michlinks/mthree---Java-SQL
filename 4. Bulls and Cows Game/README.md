# Project Aims: 
Incorporate MySQL by utilising JDBC

# Exercise:
Simulate the game Bulls and Cows where a random 4 digit sequence is generated and the user must guess it. After each guess, the user is told how many exact and partial matches the sequence they entered has to the generated one and they have 10 guesses to correctly guess the numbers. After which, the game stats and all their guesses with round results are printed to the screen. The programme also allows the user to view all games and guesses from the two SQL tables as well as specific game results. 

# Skills Developed:
- MVCS pattern for even looser coupling
- Usage of JDBC to incorporate MySQL
- MySQL multi-table queries
